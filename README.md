## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor
- **UI Components**: Radix UI
- **Icons**: React Icons

## Usage

1. Select a programming language from the dropdown
2. Write your code in the Monaco editor
3. Click "Run" to execute
4. View output in the console panel
5. Use tabs to work on multiple files

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with separate executor hooks for each language:

- `useJsExecutor`: JavaScript execution using Web Workers
- `usePhpExecutor`: PHP execution using php-wasm
- `usePythonExecutor`: Python execution using Pyodide
- `useJavaExecutor`: Java execution using CheerpJ (WebAssembly)
- `useCExecutor`: C compilation and execution using WCC (WebAssembly)

Special thanks to all the amazing open-source compiler projects that made this possible: php-wasm, Pyodide, CheerpJ, and WCC. This project wouldn't exist without their incredible work!
